  # Wikipedia is a free-content online encyclopedia written and maintained by a community of volunteers, collectively known as Wikipedians, through open collaboration and using a wiki-based editing system called           MediaWiki. Wikipedia is the largest and most-read reference work in history, and has consistently been one of the 10 most popular websites. Founded by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger on January 15, 2001, it is hosted      by the Wikimedia Foundation, an American nonprofit organization.
